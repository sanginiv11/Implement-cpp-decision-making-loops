AIM: To study and implement C++ decision making statements Loops

ALGORITHM:

(01) PRINT EVEN NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 10
1. Start the program.
2. Use a loop variable i starting from 1 up to 10.
3. For each value of i from 1 to 10, do the following:
4. Check if i is divisible by 2 (i.e., i % 2 == 0).
5. If true, print the value of i.
6. Repeat step 3 until i exceeds 10.
7. End the program

(02) PRINT SIT 5 TIMES
1. Start the program.
2. Use a loop variable i starting from 0 up to 4.
3. For each value of i, do the following:
4. Print the value of i+1 followed by a dot and the word "SIT" on a new line.
5. Repeat step 3 until the loop ends (i reaches 4).
6. End the program

(03) PROGRAM USING FOR-CONTINUE LOOP 
1. Start the program.
2. Use a loop variable i starting from 1 up to 9.
3. For each value of i, do the following:
4. Check if i is divisible by 2 (i.e., i % 2 == 0).
5. If true, use continue to skip the rest of the loop and move to the next iteration.
6. If false, print the value of i followed by a space.
7. Repeat step 3 until i reaches 9.
8. End the program

(04) LEFT ALIGNED INVERSE STAR PATTERN
1. Start the program.
2. Use an outer loop variable i starting from 6 down to 1 (decrementing by 1 each time).
3. For each value of i, do the following:
4. Use an inner loop variable j starting from 1 up to i.
5. For each value of j, print a star (* ).
6. After the inner loop ends, print a newline to move to the next row.
7. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the outer loop ends (i reaches 1).
8. End the program.

(05) RIGHT ALIGNED STAR TRIANGLE
1. Start the program.
2. Use an outer loop variable i from 1 to 6 (for each row).
3. For each row:
4. Use an inner loop variable j from 1 to (6 - i):
5. Print two spaces "  " to create the right alignment.
6. Use another inner loop variable k from 1 to i:
7. Print a star followed by a space ("* ").
8. After printing spaces and stars for the row, print a newline to move to the next row.
9. Repeat step 3 until all 6 rows are printed.
10. End the program.

(06) CENTRE ALIGNED TRIANGLE
1. Start the program.
2. Use an outer loop variable i starting from 6 down to 1 (for each row).
3. For each row:
4. Use an inner loop variable j from 0 to i:
5. Print a single space " " to create the left padding for center alignment.
6. Use another inner loop variable k from 6 down to i:
7. Print a space followed by a star (" *") to form the triangle.
8. After printing spaces and stars for the row, print a newline to move to the next row.
9. Repeat step 3 until all rows are printed.
10. End the program.

(07) LEFT ALIGNED NUMBER TRIANGLE
1. Start the program.
2. Initialize an integer variable a to 1.
3. Use an outer loop variable i from 0 to 3 (to control the number of rows).
4. For each row (i):
5. Use an inner loop variable j from 0 to i:
6. Print the current value of a followed by a space.
7. Increment a by 1.
8. After the inner loop ends, print a newline to move to the next row.
9. Repeat step 4 until all rows are printed.
10. End the program.

(08) LEFT ALIGNED STAR PATTERN
1. Start the program.
2. Use an outer loop variable i from 1 to 6 (for each row).
3. For each value of i:
4. Use an inner loop variable j from 1 to i:
5. Print a star (* ).
6. After the inner loop ends, print a newline to move to the next row.
7. Repeat steps 3 until all 6 rows are printed.
8. End the program.

(09) PRINT NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 20
1. Start the program.
2. Use a loop variable i starting from 1 up to 20.
3. For each value of i from 1 to 20, do the following:
4. Print the value of i followed by a space.
5. Repeat step 3 until i exceeds 20.
6. End the program.

(10) AUTHENTICATE THE PASSWORD
1. Start the program.
2. Declare two string variables: one for the correct password and one for user input.
3. Set the correct password (e.g., "Sangini").
4. Prompt the user to enter the password.
5. Read the user's input.
6. Compare the user's input with the correct password:
7. If the input matches the password, print "Access granted."
8. Otherwise, print "Access denied. Incorrect password."
9. End the program.
